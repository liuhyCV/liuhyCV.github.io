<img class="profile-picture" src="portfolio_1.jpg">
 
Hi! I am a Computer Vision researcher at [MEGVII(Face++)](https://www.megvii.com), Beijing Research Institute.


## Research Interest
My research is on Computer Vision and Deep Learning, with a particular interest in understanding how to sense the environments, such as Object Detection, Object Tracking, Semantic Segmentation and Panoptic Segmentation.


## News

[2019/03] Our paper OANet is accepted by **CVPR2019** in Long Beach, California.

[2018/09] As a team member of Megvii(Face++)-R4D Team, we won the **1st place** of COCO Panoptic Segmentation and Mapillary Panoptic Segmentation in the COCO & Mapillary Panoptic Segmentation Challenge 2018.
